# AzurePR TUI
## 🤔 What is this?

<img width="1566" height="898" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f934800f-0c22-480c-8916-d00839897726" />

Microsoft broke the PR overview in Azure DevOps boards (thanks, Satya 🙃), so I hacked together a terminal UI that shows you open PRs and some quick info.
Runs in your Windows terminal, just a single .exe.

## 🛠 Why does this exist?

Weekend boredom + AI-assisted chaos = this tool.
Use at your own risk. (Pretty sure it’s safe—no secrets leaking as far as I can tell.)

## 🔑 Requirements

You’ll need a Personal Access Token (PAT) with:

- Code (Read)

To setup a PAT in Azure DevOps, look at [this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops&tabs=Windows)

## 🚀 Installation
Option 1: Download the release

1) Grab the latest .exe from [Releases](https://github.com/lazynormz/DevOps_PR/releases)

2) Drop it somewhere permanent (e.g. C:\Tools\AzurePR).

Option 2: Build it yourself

```
go build -o bin/AzurePR.exe
```

### Add it to PATH (recommended)

So you can just type AzurePR anywhere in your terminal:

1) Put AzurePR.exe in a folder like C:\Tools\AzurePR.

2) Add that folder to your System PATH:

    - Windows Search → “Edit system environment variables”

     - Environment Variables → Path → Edit → Add C:\Tools\AzurePR

Now you can run:
```
AzurePR
```

### (Optional) Symlink

If you don’t want to mess with PATH every time:
```
mklink "C:\Windows\System32\AzurePR.exe" "C:\Tools\AzurePR\AzurePR.exe"
```
⚠️ Needs admin rights.

## ⚙️ Using

When launching the application for the first time, you'll be asked for 3 different information:

1) what organization to look into
2) what project to work with
3) your PAT yo should have generated by now

### 🔁 Resetting

If for some reason you need to change any of the previous details, you can run the following command which will have you repeat the steps from when you first started the application

```sh
AzurePR reset
```

## 🏗 Building

Requires Go 1.25.0

Build with:
```
go build -o bin/AzurePR.exe
```

# ⚠️ Notes

Only tested on Windows for now.

Expect some rough edges—it’s more “weekend hack” than “production-ready.”
